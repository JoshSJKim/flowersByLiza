## Things to look into

- I initially thought it would be a good idea to create a 'banner-like' nav bar that will stay stationary throughout all of the ul element pages.
- So I copied what I initially had on the index.html file and transferred it to about, team, and contact.html files.
- But when I tried to edit something in the nav-bar on the index.html file, I realized I had to make the same changes on all of the other html files.
- I'd better look into `navbars` a little more.
