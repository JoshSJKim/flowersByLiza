    <p class="description">Cherry Blossom Floral Studio, based in Mississauga, Ontario, offers professional, tailored wedding floral design services.<br> Liza Heejeong Chun, the owner/operator of Cherry Blossom, discovered her passion for wedding floral arrangements while designing beautiful pieces for her sisterâ€™s wedding. She is deeply inspired by nature, captivated by interesting textures, and motivated by vibrant colors. Although she hasn't received any formal training in floral arrangements, her background in theater production gives her an extraordinary ability to envision the clients' wedding, and bring to life the most memorable "stage" for the bride and groom (as well as the guests).<br> Cherry Blossom Floral Studio focuses on the finer details, to provide a comprehensive design experience that vividly portrays the essence of the commencement of a life-long journey.</p>
